# Introduction
This program allows you to bind the Steam Overlay to your game for RPG Maker VX Ace using Microsoft's ```Detours```

Before starting this tool, you need to place a dll file such as ```SteamClient.dll``` and ```steam_api.dll```, ```steam_appid.txt``` files.

But ```SteamClient.dll``` is used a default configuration so you need to compile directly at <a href="https://github.com/biud436/SteamClient">SteamClient</a>
